# Database_Project

A database application made using C# and SQL for Gulzar – e – Rahim Boy Scouts Association in Pakistan.  

## Overview

In this project we created a database for Gulzar-e-Rahim Boy Scouts. It is an organization which is divided into 3 units namely Shaheen Scouts, Boy Scouts and Rover Scouts. Each unit has scouts belonging to a certain age group. A scout in these units can earn badges of two types namely proficiency badges and high rank badges. These badges however are different for different units. 
We created a database for this organization which has both a front-end and a back-end working system. The back-end contains a relational database created using SQL server, which is actually a systematic assembly of data of this organization in the form of tables. These tables contain data such as personal details of all scouts, scout’s attendance and fee record, camps, events and, awards etc. 
The front-end consists of different forms like any other system application, to be used by the end user. The database allows the end user to edit information of an existing scout, facilitates new admission, allows badge nomination which generates an excel file of all the eligible scouts on the format provided by Sindh boy scouts association, allows user to update scout attendance, fee records, events and camps taking place in this organization. 

## How to use

Download the executable folder and run double click the .exe file to run. Provide the information asked in the forms to proceed.

## Note

This is an old classroom project and therefore prone to bugs and inconsistencies. The code could not be uploaded because it requires a database backend which can not be uploaded either.
